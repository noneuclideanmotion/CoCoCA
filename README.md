# CoCoCA
Continuous Complex Cellular Automata

A Cellular Automata that can accept any 9 parameter function with perameters of type <Type> and a return type of type <Type> where <Type> is the type of the grid (e.g. Complex, double, int) determined at compiletime.
  
TODO:
  - GPU support
  - Variable thread counts
  - Integration with lua or python for runtime determination of functions
