# Continuous Complex Cellular Automata

A Cellular Automata that can accept any 9 parameter function with perameters of type <Type> and a return type of type <Type> where <Type> is the type of the grid (e.g. Complex, double, int) determined at compiletime.
  
Requires a copy of SFML 2.5.1 to compile

Use mouse to activate cells (Value 1) and space to run the simulation. Press F to move forward one frame.
  
# To do:
  - GPU support
  - Variable thread counts
  - Integration with lua or python for runtime determination of functions
